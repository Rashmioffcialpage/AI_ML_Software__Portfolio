AI / ML / Software Engineering Portfolio
By Rashmi — Master’s in Artificial Intelligence, Long Island University (2026)

Welcome to my comprehensive AI/ML + Software Engineering Portfolio, built to showcase the full spectrum of my technical skills for 2026 internship opportunities across AI, Machine Learning, Software Engineering, Full-Stack Development, and Data Science.

This repository contains 15 professionally structured projects ranging from foundational ML implementations to advanced LLMs, MLOps pipelines, YOLO models, full-stack web apps, and real-time systems.

📌 Portfolio Goals

This portfolio demonstrates:

✔ Strong understanding of core ML algorithms & theory

✔ Real-world experience with deep learning, NLP, CV, LLM fine-tuning, RL

✔ Ability to build production-ready systems (FastAPI, MERN stack, CI/CD)

✔ Skills in data preprocessing, model evaluation & visualization

✔ Solid foundations in DSA, Python, and software engineering

✔ Hands-on projects using TensorFlow, PyTorch, HuggingFace, YOLOv8
